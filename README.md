# CTCI_Problems
This is a repository to keep track of practice 
questions done in the book Cracking the Coding Interview (CTCI). 
I will solve the problems as I work through the book and take notes. 

Following the directions of the book for each question I will try to solve the 
question with pen and paper then after transcribe it to code. 

As I go through these I will think of the data structures used, time complexity, 
space complexity and other topics that could be discussed when seeing these 
questions.
